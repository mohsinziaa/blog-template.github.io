        <h1>Child Labour</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>"Child labour"</strong> refers to the exploitation of children
          through any form of work that deprives children of their childhood,
          interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and is
          mentally, physically, socially and morally harmful. Such exploitation
          is prohibited by legislation worldwide, although these laws do not
          consider all work by children as child labour; exceptions include work
          by child artists, family duties, supervised training, and some forms
          of child work practiced by Amish children, as well as by indigenous
          children in the Americas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Child labour has existed to varying extents throughout history. During
          the 19th and early 20th centuries, many children aged 5 - 14 from
          poorer families worked in Western nations and their colonies alike.
          These children mainly worked in agriculture, home-based assembly
          operations, factories, mining, and services such as news boys - some
          worked night shifts lasting 12 hours. With the rise of household
          income, availability of schools and passage of child labour laws, the
          incidence rates of child labour fell.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the world's poorest countries, around one in four children are
          engaged in child labour, the highest number of whom 29% live in
          sub-saharan Africa. In 2017, four African nations (Mali, Benin, Chad
          and Guinea-Bissau) witnessed over 50 percent of children aged 5- 14
          working. Worldwide agriculture is the largest employer of child
          labour. The vast majority of child labour is found in rural settings
          and informal urban economies; children are predominantly employed by
          their parents, rather than factories. Poverty and lack of schools are
          considered the primary cause of child labour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Child labour played an important role in the Industrial Revolution
          from its outset, often brought about by economic hardship. The
          children of the poor were expected to contribute to their family
          income. In 19th-century Great Britain, one-third of poor families were
          without a breadwinner, as a result of death or abandonment, obliging
          many children to work from a young age. In England and Scotland in
          1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mills were
          described as children. A high number of children also worked as
          prostitutes. The author Charles Dickens worked at the age of 12 in a
          blacking factory, with his family in debtor's prison. Child wages were
          often low, the wages were as little as 10 - 20% of an adult male's
          wage.[better source nee Karl Marx was an outspoken opponent of child
          labour, saying British industries "could but live by sucking blood,
          and children's blood too", and that U.S. capital was financed by the
          "capitalized blood of children". Letitia Elizabeth Landon castigated
          child labour in her 1835 poem The Factory, portions of which she
          pointedly included in her 18th Birthday Tribute to Princess Victoria
          in 1837. Throughout the second half of the 19th century, child labour
          began to decline in industrialised societies due to regulation and
          economic factors because of the Growth of trade unions. The regulation
          of child labour began from the earliest days of the Industrial
          Revolution. The first act to regulate child labour in Britain was
          passed in 1803.
